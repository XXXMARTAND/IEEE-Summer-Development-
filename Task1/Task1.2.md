## Task 1.2

### Deadline :27 May, 23:59

In this task, you are supposed to make a fully functional REST API with atleast GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE(optional) requests. You are supposed to make a random Dice generator and a random chance tool (for eg Dice has 6 sample space, Toss has 2 sample space. Your random chance tool should have an open end sample space. ie you can add sample space element in the form of numbers) 
the API should roughly do the following
<ul>
  <li>GET request should generate a random value from the sample space of both the API</li>
  <li>POST request should return an error in JSON for the first API whereas add to sample space in the second API</li> 
  <li>DELETE request same as above</li>
  </ul>

Go through documentations of Node and/or flask to know more about Request Implementations. No need to publish your API. For now you can test your API using Postman

### NOTE: Google problems, Search answers on stackOverflow, read documentations and debug errors. Submit both the API files separately
